{"lyrics": "Rolf :You wait, little girl, on an empty stageFor fate to turn the light on (light on)Your life, little girl, is an empty pageThat men will want to write on..Liesl: To write on..You are sixteen going on seventeenBaby, it's time to thinkBetter beware, be canny and carefulBaby, you're on the brinkYou are sixteen going on seventeenFellows will fall in lineEager young lads and rogues and cadsWill offer you food and wineTotally unprepared are youTo face a world of menTimid and shy and scared are youOf things beyond your kinYou need someone older and wiserTelling you what to doI am seventeen going on eighteenI'll take care of youLiesl :I am sixteen going on seventeenI know that I'm naiveFellows I meet may tell me I'm sweetAnd willingly I'll believeI am sixteen going on seventeenInnocent as a roseBachelor dandies, drinkers of brandiesWhat do I know of those?Totally unprepared am ITo face a world of menTimid and shy and scared am IOf things beyond my kinI need someone older and wiserTelling me what to doYou are seventeen going on eighteenI'll depend on you"}
